My name is Kevin Escobar. I eat good food. It is a wonderful pleasure to meet you!
I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.
The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart
Why, sometimes I have believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
A heart is not judged by how much you love; but by how much you are loved by others
